lua-MessagePack : a pure Lua implementation
===========================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fperrad/lua-MessagePack.png)](https://travis-ci.org/fperrad/lua-MessagePack)

Introduction
------------

[MessagePack](http://msgpack.org/) is an efficient binary serialization format.

It lets you exchange data among multiple languages like JSON but it's faster and smaller.

It's a pure Lua implementation, without dependency.

And it's really fast with LuaJIT.
